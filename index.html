        <p class="lead">“I have cerebral palsy and this is my attempt at passing on some of what it is to have a
            physical
            disability and how life has panned out for me.” In her beautifully illustrated memoir, Lottie describes her life in a clear-eyed and
            whimsical way — from
            loving family to institutional care to independence and beyond. Here Goes… is both a social history of
            living disabled in New Zealand from 1962 to 2017 and a personal reflection on making a good life
            undeterred by vulnerability, dependence and an ageing body. Lottie imbues her recollections with a sense
            of joy — in her words, “so wonderful to be free with all my thoughts and my dreams”.</p>

                <p>“You must let me do for myself all that I can do.”
                    “We spend our lives trying to prove that we’re independent.”</p>
                This memoir is a frank and joyous account of a fascinating life. Lottie’s humanity, courage, mischief
                and
                good humour, faith, and love of family and friends leaps from the pages. Her ability to live life to the
                fullest — in the face of physical obstacles that many of us would find disheartening — is inspirational.
                This book, beautifully illustrated with drawings and photos from the first six decades of Lottie’s life,
                deserves a wide readership in New Zealand and beyond.

                A truly moving memoir that tells of Lottie’s journey through her own words. Lottie is a strong,
                compassionate woman who is an example to us all of how our own world view, friends and family can
                support a full and rich life despite any challenges. Her independence, determination and ability to
                remain positive and upbeat is an inspiration to others. This is an insightful read especially for young
                people with a disability as well as for those who support them to lead full lives. I thoroughly enjoyed
                reading Lottie’s journey.

                In this memoir, Lottie recounts the milestones in her life that have shaped her into the person she is
                today. This book provides an insight into living with disability as Lottie expounds some of the
                challenges that she has experienced and the impact they have had (and continue to have) on her life. But
                of course, it is also clear from her narrative that there are many other aspects of her life that have
                been influential and important. Lottie describes many of her hobbies, friends and her faith that have
                played a large part. It is also clear that an important constant has been her loving family, who have
                supported her in many ways. One of the people that Lottie dedicates the book to is her childhood
                physiotherapist, Maude Blomkamp, who Lottie describes treated her as a person to be respected and
                encouraged. Although many aspects of physiotherapy have changed over the intervening years, this focus
                on viewing people as people first and aspects of their health condition as secondary remains a
                cornerstone of good healthcare. Indeed, what this memoir reveals is Lottie, the person whose life
                experience has inevitably been shaped by cerebral palsy but that is only part of who she is today. We
                see her as a determined, creative, fun-loving and family-oriented person.
